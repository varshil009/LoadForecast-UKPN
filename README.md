# Load Forecast for UKPN Power Networks Portal Data

This project focuses on load forecasting using data from the **UK Power Networks Open Data Portal**. The dataset is updated daily and includes historical electricity flow measurements from 2021 to 2024. With over 12 million data points, this dataset provides a comprehensive view of the grid's performance.

## Load Forecasting Approach

The methodology for load forecasting is as follows:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize numerical features to standardize the range.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create lag features and rolling statistics to capture temporal patterns.
   - Encode categorical variables like `GSP` and `SGT`.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Utilize advanced neural networks such as LSTMs or Transformers for capturing time-dependent patterns.
   - Incorporate exogenous variables like weather or market data to improve model accuracy.

4. **Training and Validation**:
   - Train models using historical data and evaluate their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ².

5. **Forecasting**:
   - Predict future load profiles using the trained models.

## Potential Applications

- Real-time load forecasting for efficient grid management.
- Detection of anomalies in power consumption patterns.
- Insights for energy trading and demand response programs.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the latest dataset from the UK Power Networks Open Data Portal. The dataset is found [here](https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-super-grid-transformer/information/)
3. The models.ipynb contains 2 models, in which you can either load pre-trained TAT which is here in repository named TAT2_weekly or you can train both models. Please keep the TAT.py and nn_forecast.py in same folder with your current running file.
4. The LSTM have different code file and you can directly run the LSTMSmartGrid.ipynb
5. Also included the errors.py file where you can just import the error_df function and give results with test values to get table for results with model name.
